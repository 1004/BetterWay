# BetterWay

This is an open source project using the MVP mode, using RxJava2, Retrofit, Dagger2, EventBus and other open source projects. Based on an app made by the gaode map API, the following functions are implemented in this app:

1. Use RxJava2 and Retrofit to implement the bing daily chart and display on the home page.

2. Using the NDK to achieve the special effects.

3. Use cross-process communication to implement the calendar reminders.

In the process of software development, the agent mode, observer pattern and other design patterns are implemented.

With this app, we can plan in any city in China, and we can get the schedule through a series of locations, and we can plan the time more reasonably.
